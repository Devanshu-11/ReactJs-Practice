// react.js is a javascript library which is used to create the dynamic and interactive user interface and it is library and Vue.js and Angular.js is a frameworks and library offers a specific functionality and frameworks provides all tools and guidlines

// react.js is a javascript library which is used to create the dynamic and interactive user interface
// it is developed by facebook
// with the help of react.js we can create the single page application
// we can also use reusable UI components

// DOM- document object model
// when we create a HTML file and loads into the browser then browser converts into a tree like structure called real dom. javascript directly changes the data of real dom but in reactJs, there is a concept of virtual dom and it creates copy of virtual dom and when we changes data, it firstly changes in virtual dom and then it checks, if the data changes, it changes the real dom otherwise not and actual updating in real dom is made by reactDom

// components- they are independent and reusable bit of code. In simple words, we can say that we particulary used the components for its code reusability by only define it one time
// The main component also known as the root is known as App

// IDE- integrated development environment and it is a software that particularly provides all basic tools to create our web application. it provide all tools for coding, finding problems and testing and it overall increases the efficiency

// public folder- it contains static files that does not changes 
// package.json- it contains the information about the project like-name, versions, dependencies etc

// jsx-javascript xml
// it allows us to write the html tags in the react
// jsx will determine how the ui will look whenever the component is used 

// babel.js.io/repl- online tool allows us to see how the jsx code is transformed into the javascript code

// Naming convention must be capitalized and html tags should be in lower case in the case of the react version.

// Bootstrap-works in all devices as it is responsive and it gives prestyled elements such as button, navbars etc and it is very easy to modify its default styles

// Key in map function-Keys allow React to keep track of elements so by this way, if an item is updated or removed, only that item will be re-rendered instead of the entire list.

// Condition Rendering- it displays the content based on the certain conditions and allows rendering for dynamic user interfaces

// props- it means properties and it is mechanism for passing the data from the parent component to child component but also if child can communicating to the parents by passing functions via props and in simple words, we can say parent defines a function and the child invokes it

// React events use Camelcase eg-onClick etc and event handlers can be functions or the arrow functions and also event handlers are written inside curly braces

// Managing states-basically state represents the data that changes over the time and the state is associated over the particular component and state changes causes the component to render and in functional state component, we use useState hooks

// useState hook- it returns the array which has 2 elements 
// 1-current state 
// 2- A function that updates the state

// useReference hook-it allows access to the dom elements and retain mutable values without re-renders and it used with ref attributes for direct dom interaction
